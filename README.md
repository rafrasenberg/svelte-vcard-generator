# Svelte.js vCard Generator

A little app made while learning Svelte.js, uses the QRserver API to generate a vCard based on the form input. 

Some of the concepts of Svelte that are handled in this app:

- Component hierarchy
- Reactivity with dynamic attributes
- Two-way binding
- Conditional classes
- SCSS integration
- Dispatching events
- Slots
- Reactive statements

You can use it as a reference to reverse-engineer or play around with some of the different concepts of Svelte.
